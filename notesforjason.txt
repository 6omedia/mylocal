	CATEGORY (INDUSTRY) IMAGES

	Category (industry) images load from the folder public/img/backgrounds.
	the name of the image is the name of the industry plus .jpg.
	If no image is found it uses default.jpg.
	So if you want an industry to display a background just put an image in the folder...

		/public/img/backgrounds

	and call it by the industry name and save as a jpg.

	These images are displayed on the home page in featured categories, on a listing page that has no background
	set and on the category page its self.

	LOCATION IMAGES

	Same deal as above only the folder path is public/img/locations
